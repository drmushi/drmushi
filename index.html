    <br/>
  
   
    <p>I am an Educational Technologist with over seven years experience in E-learning, Online Facilitation and Open Educational Resources (OER).<br/> 
   I am currently pursuing a doctoral program in <strong>Learning Design and Technology</strong> at <a href="https://www.ncsu.edu/"target="_blank">North Carolina State University</a>.<br/.>
   Prior to joining NCSTATE, I had worked as an Educational Technologist at the Open University of Tanzania (OUT). My main role has been to support the integration of Information and Communication Technologies in teaching and learning processes at the university.<br/>

    <h2>Educational Technology Tools</h2>
    <p>Having worked as an educational technologist, I have been exposed to a number of tools that I have found intriguing and helpful.<br/>
     I believe these tools have enhanced my instructional experience especially in developing robust learning resources</p>
    <h3 class="miniheadings">Kahoot!</h3>
    <p>This is an interactive game-based quiz tool that makes learning fun and engaging. The best part about Kahoot is that it is user-friendly and it can run on multiple platforms</p>
    <h3 class="miniheadings">Padlet</h3>
    <p>Padlet is an excellent tool that can be used by learners of all stages. It provides a creative way of collaborating and displaying content.<br/>
    It is easy to use and it supports all kinds of media resources. </p>
    <h3 class="miniheadings">Articulate Storyline</h3>
    <p>This is an excellent software for authoring e-learning content and anything that has to do with online courses.</p>
